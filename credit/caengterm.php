Liability for  unauthorized charges shall not exceed the lesser of $50.00 or the amount  obtained by the unauthorized use before notification pursuant to this  provision.  Unauthorized use does not  include (1) any use from which you receive a benefit or (2) use by any person  to whom you have given the credit card or authority to use the account, and you  will be liable for all use by such person or persons.  To terminate this authority, you must notify CURACAO.  You agree to attempt to retrieve the credit  card from the previously authorized user and return it to CURACAO at the  address mentioned above.<br>
  <strong>Line of Credit</strong><strong>.</strong>  We will notify  you of your credit line when your account is approved.  We may increase or decrease your line of  credit from time to time.  If you exceed  your credit line, we may find you in default.   We may suspend your credit line or take other actions in the event of  such a default.<br>
  <strong>Promise to pay</strong><strong>.</strong>  You agree to  pay us in U.S. Dollars for all purchases made including all applicable interest  charges, fees and other charges incurred by you or any other person you  authorize to use your card or account, even if you do not notify us that they  are using the account.  If your account  is a joint account, each of you agrees to be individually liable for the entire  balance due on your account.  We can  accept late or partial payments or instruments marked paid in full without  waiving or losing any of our rights under this agreement.<br>
  <strong>Monthly Billing Statement</strong><strong>.  </strong>We  will send you a billing statement after each monthly billing period in which  you have a credit or balance in excess of $1.00. The billing statement will  show all purchases, interest charges, other charges or fees and all payments or  other credits posted to your account for that period.  Billing statements will also show your New  Balance, Minimum Payment Due, and Payment Due Date.<br>
  <strong>Monthly Payment Options</strong><strong>.</strong>  You may pay the  entire New Balance shown on your billing statement at any time.  If you choose to pay anything less than the  entire New Balance, the amount you pay may not be less than the Minimum Payment  Due.  All payments must be mailed or  delivered to CURACAO or at the address shown on your monthly billing  statement.   Payment will be credited as  of date of receipt if received by 5:00 PM otherwise it will be credited on the  next processing day.<br>
  <strong>Failure to make the Minimum  Payment</strong><strong>. </strong>If you do  not make at least the Minimum Payment Due by the Payment Due Date each month  you will be charged a late fee and may be found in default.<br>
  <strong>Credit Balances</strong><strong>.</strong>  We will refund  any credit balance within 7 business days from receipt of your written  request.  If you do not request a refund,  we will automatically refund any credit balance in excess of $1.00 after 90  days if your account is inactive.<br>
  <strong>INTEREST charges</strong><strong>.</strong>  Periodic  interest on your account is figured by multiplying the average daily balance  during the billing period by the monthly periodic rate set forth in the Pricing  Information Table.  The corresponding  annual percentage rate (&ldquo;APR&rdquo;) is also set forth in the Pricing Information  Table, and the monthly periodic rate is equal to the corresponding APR divided  by 12.  We begin to impose interest  charges from the date that a transaction is added to your daily balance.  Transactions include purchases, interest  charges and fees.  We continue to impose  interest charges until we credit your account with full payment of the total amount  you owe us.<br>
  <strong>AVERAGE DAILY BALANCE</strong><strong>.</strong>  The daily  balance for any day is equal to the previous day&rsquo;s balance plus any new  purchases, interest charges and fees and minus any payments and credits made to  the account that day.  At the end of the  billing period, we will add up all the daily balances and then divide that  amount by the number of days in the billing period to arrive at your average  daily balance for the period.<br>
  <strong>MINIMUM INTEREST  CHARGE.</strong>  The total balance is subject to a minimum  interest charge of $1.50 for each period in which an interest charge will be  assessed.<br>
  <strong>Minimum payment</strong>.  The minimum  payment for each billing period will equal (1) the applicable percentage of the  New Balance set forth in the following table plus (2) any past due amounts  appearing on your statement plus (3) any late payment fees and any returned payment  fees appearing on your statement. You can always pay more than the required  minimum payment.</p>

      <p align="center"><strong>If    you are a guarantor or cosigner for the account, the following notice applies    to you.</strong></p>
      <h3 align="center">NOTICE TO COSIGNER (TRADUCCION EN INGLES SE REQUIERE POR LA LEY)</h3>
      <p>You    are being asked to guarantee this debt.     Think carefully before you do.     If the borrower doesn&rsquo;t pay the debt, you will have to.  Be sure you can afford to pay if you have    to, and that you want to accept this responsibility.<br>
        You    may have to pay up to the full amount of the debt if the borrower does not    pay. You may also have to pay late fees or collection costs, which increase    this amount.<br>
        The    creditor can collect this debt from you without first trying to collect from    the borrower.  The creditor can use the    same collection methods against you that can be used against the borrower,    such as suing you, garnishing your wages, etc. If this debt is ever in    default, that fact may become a part of <em>your</em> credit record.<br>
        This    notice is not the contract that makes you liable for the debt.<br>
        <strong>AVISO PARA EL    FIADOR (SPANISH TRANSLATION REQUIRED BY LAW)</strong><br>
        Se le está pidiendo que garantice esta deuda. Piénselo    con cuidado antes de ponerse de acuerdo. Si la persona que ha pedido este préstamo    no paga la deuda, usted tendrá que pagarla. Este seguro de que usted podrá    pagar si sea obligado a pagarla y de que usted desea aceptar la responsabilidad.<br>
        Si la persona que ha pedido el préstamo no paga la    deuda, es posible que usted tenga que pagar la suma total de la deuda, más    los cargos por tardarse en el pago o el costo de cobranza, lo cual aumenta el    total de esta suma.<br>
        El acreedor (financiero) puede cobrarle a usted sin,    primeramente, tratar de cobrarle al deudor. Los mismos métodos de cobranza    que pueden usarse contra el deudor, podrán usarse contra usted, tales como    presentar una demanda en corte, quitar parte de su sueldo, etc. Si alguna vez    no se cumpla con la obligación de pagar esta deuda, se puede incluir esa información    en la historia de crédito de usted.<br>
        Este aviso no es el contrato mismo en que se le echa    a usted la responsabilidad de la deuda.</p>

  <em>Account  information:  </em>Your name and  account number.<br>
  <em>Dollar  amount:  </em>The dollar  amount of the suspected error.<br>
  <em>Description of  problem:  </em>If you think  there is an error on your bill, describe what you believe is wrong and why you  believe it is a mistake.<br>
  <br>
  You must contact us:<br>
  Within  60 days after the error appeared on your statement.<br>
  At  least 3 business days before an automated payment is scheduled, if you want to  stop payment on the amount you think is wrong.<br>
  <br>
  You must notify us of any potential errors in writing.  You may call us, but if you do we are not  required to investigate any potential errors and you may have to pay the amount  in question.</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>What Will Happen After We  Receive Your Letter</em></li>
  <li>When  we receive your letter, we must do two things:<br>
  </li>
  <li>Within  30 days of receiving your letter, we must tell you that we received your  letter.  We will also tell you if we have  already corrected the error.</li>
  <li>Within  90 days of receiving your letter, we must either correct the error or explain  to you why we believe the bill is correct.   While we investigate whether or not there has been an error:</li>
  <li>We  cannot try to collect the amount in question, or report you as delinquent on  that amount.</li>
  <li>The  charge in question may remain on your statement, and we may continue to charge  you interest on that amount.</li>
  <li>While  you do not have to pay the amount in question, you are responsible for the  remainder of your balance.</li>
  <li>We  can apply any unpaid amount against your credit limit.<br>
  </li>
  <li>After  we finish our investigation, one of two things will happen:<br>
  </li>
  <li><em>If we made a  mistake:</em>  You will not have to pay the amount in  question or any interest or other fees related to that amount.</li>
  <li><em>If we do not  believe there was a mistake:  </em>You will have  to pay the amount in question, along with applicable interest and fees.  We will send you a statement of the amount  you owe and the date payment is due.  We  may then report you as delinquent if you do not pay the amount we think you  owe.</li>
  <li>&nbsp;</li>
  <li>If  you receive our explanation but still believe your bill is wrong, you must  write to us within 10 days telling us that you still refuse to pay.  If you do so, we cannot report you as  delinquent without also reporting that you are questioning your bill.  We must tell you the name of anyone to whom  we reported you as delinquent, and we must let those organizations know when  the matter has been settled between us.</li>
  <li>If  we do not follow all of the rules above, you do not have to pay the first $50  of the amount you question even if your bill is correct.</li>
  <li><em>Your Rights If You Are Dissatisfied  With Your Credit Card Purchases</em></li>
  <li>If  you are dissatisfied with the goods or services that you have purchased with  your credit card and you have tried in good faith to correct the problem with  the merchant, you may have the right not to pay the remaining amount due on the  purchase.</li>
  <li>To  use this right, all of the following must be true:</li>
  <li>The  purchase must have been made in your home state or within 100 miles of your  current mailing address, and the purchase price must have been more than  $50.  [Note:  Neither of these are necessary if your  purchase was based on an advertisement we mailed to you, or if we own the  company that sold you the goods or services.]</li>
  <li>You  must have used your credit card for the purchase.  Purchases made with cash advances from an ATM  or with a check that accesses your credit card account do not qualify.</li>
  <li>You  must not yet have fully paid for the purchase.   If all of the criteria above are met and you are still dissatisfied with  the purchase, contact us <em>in writing</em> at:</li>
</ul>

  Attention:  Customer Service</p>
<ul>
  <li>While  we investigate, the same rules apply to the disputed amount as discussed  above.  After we finish our  investigation, we will tell you our decision.   At that point, if we think you own an amount and you do not pay, we may  report you as delinquent.</li>
</ul>
